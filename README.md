# Lab 3 - Personal Expenses Tracker
Author: James Kanneh

## Files
- expenses-tracker.py — Python CLI application
- archive_expenses.sh — Shell script to archive expense files and log operations
- balance.txt — Starting/current balance (single number)
- archive_log.txt — Generated by the shell script after archiving

## How it works (brief)
- Balance is read from balance.txt.
- Expenses are saved to files named expenses_YYYY-MM-DD.txt with lines:
  ID|timestamp|item|amount
- Available balance = Balance − Total expenses (sum of all expenses_*.txt in working directory).
- Adding money updates balance.txt. Recording an expense writes to the day's file.
- The shell script moves expense files into ./archives and logs actions in archive_log.txt.

## Run the Python app
```bash
python3 expenses-tracker.py
